Halide is important, separation of algorithm and schedule, did not
support parallel or *vectorized* reductions till now with changing
algorithm (which fails to deliver core promise of language).\\

We present a Halide scheduling primitive (DAG transformation) that
creates a new data parallel axis out of a reduction.\\

Importance of code reduction/purity/portability e.g. for
auto-scheduling
