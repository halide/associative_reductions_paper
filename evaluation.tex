Performance results using rfactor (overall speedup) \\

Synthetic functions (also to show limitations) \\

Limitations: we need an identity, merge func = intermediate \\

Real-world stuff \\

Performance of generation/search/synthesis. <TODO: Not sure what this is about? > \\

Case study of Importance of "code reduction"? <TODO: Not sure what this is about? > \\
