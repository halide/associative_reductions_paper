\subsection{rfactor DAG Transformation}
Assuming associate operator is given. \\
Figures with code before/after examples.

\subsection{Deducing Associative Operator}
Deducing the associative operator from an update definition (forward synthesis -> backward synthesis using Rosette for int 32-bit complex multiplication takes 50 minutes to finish). \\
Generate all associate ops and search. \\
Reduce the problem before the search by reasoning on the graph of cross-talk between tuple elements. \\
