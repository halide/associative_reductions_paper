 ABSTRACT = {
  Supercompilers must reschedule computations defined by
                  nested DO-loops in order to make an efficient use of
                  supercomputer features (vector units, multiple elementary
                  processors, cache memory, etc…). Many rescheduling
                  techniques like loop interchange, loop strip-mining or
                  rectangular partitioning have been described to speedup
                  program execution. We present here a class of partitionings
                  that encompasses previous techniques and provides enough
                  flexibility to adapt code to multiprocessors with two levels
                  of parallelism and two levels of memory. }

 ABSTRACT = {
  Given a program written in a simple imperative language (assignment
  statements,for loops, affine indices and loop limits), this paper presents an
  algorithm for analyzing the patterns along which values flow as the execution
  proceeds. For each array or scalar reference, the result is the name and
  iteration vector of the source statement as a function of the iteration
  vector of the referencing statement. The paper discusses several applications
  of the method: conversion of a program to a set of recurrence equations,
  array and scalar expansion, program verification and parallel program
  construction.
